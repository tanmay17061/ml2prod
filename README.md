# ml2prod
Democratising ML systems.

## About
The number of libraries available for each phase in an ML system lifecycle can be overwhelming for even an experienced ML Engineer. It requires specialised roles (eg- MLOps Engineers) to put ML into production.

This repository (ml2prod) is an attempt to reduce the gap between a regular (Computer Scientist / Data Scientist / ML Engineer) and an MLOps Engineer.

### Foreseeable Future
The end state of this repository looks like following:

- [ ] Choose from a selection of ML system pipelines.  
- [ ] Plug-and-play your dataset in the selected pipeline.

### Distant Future
As this project matures, we would like to break components of pipelines into modular re-usable components. The exact how-tos of this are yet to be decided.

## Pipelines
